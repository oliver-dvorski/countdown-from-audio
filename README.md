Provide the script with an audio file and it will read its duration in seconds. That data will be used by ffmpeg to draw a countdown timer.

The code for the timer is based on the snippets found [here](https://bytefreaks.net/gnulinux/bash/ffmpeg-create-a-video-countdown) and [here](https://gist.github.com/derand/31b8312fd64156120cb8f45825a1f0f7)

The background image defines the video resolution.

Todo:
- [ ] --no-interaction flag to make this thing usable in loops
